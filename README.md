# P5 and React Personal Project

For lack of a better name. This is one of my current personal projects.
This project aims to incoporate the P5.js library within React components, and eventually using component state to effect the p5 sketch.

Created using creat react app

When cloning, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. Then `yarn start` to start up the server.

Created by lanelps.
